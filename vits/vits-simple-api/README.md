# Deployment

There are two deployment options to choose from. Regardless of the option you select, you'll need to import the model after deployment to use the application.

## Docker Deployment (Recommended for Linux)

### Step 1: Pull the Docker Image

Run the following command to pull the Docker image. Follow the prompts in the script to choose the necessary files to download and pull the image:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Artrajz/vits-simple-api/main/vits-simple-api-installer-latest.sh)"
```

The default paths for project configuration files and model folders are `/usr/local/vits-simple-api/`.

### Step 2: Start

Run the following command to start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Image Update

To update the image, run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

Then, restart the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Virtual Environment Deployment

### Step 1: Clone the Project

Clone the project repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Artrajz/vits-simple-api.git
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment. Run the following command to install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Start

Run the following command to start the program:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Windows Quick Deployment Package

### Step 1: Download and Extract the Deployment Package

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Artrajz/vits-simple-api/releases) and download the latest deployment package. Extract the downloaded files.

### Step 2: Start

Run `start.bat` to launch the program.

## Model Loading

### Step 1: Download VITS Models
Download the VITS model files and place them in the Model directory.

### Step 2: Loading Models

If you are starting for the first time, modify the default model path configuration in the config.py file (optional).

After the first startup, a config.yml configuration file will be generated. You can either modify the model_list in the configuration file or make changes through the admin backend in the browser.

You can specify the model paths using either absolute or relative paths, where relative paths are considered from the Model folder in the project's root directory.

For example, if the Model folder contains the following files:

```
├─model1
│  │─G_1000.pth
│  └─config.json
└─model2
   │─G_1000.pth
   └─config.json
```

You have multiple options for specifying the paths based on your preference.

Option 1:

```
'model_config':
  'model_list': 
  - - model1/G_1000.pth
    - model1/config.json
  - - model2/G_1000.pth
    - model2/config.json
```

Option 2:

```
'model_config':
  'model_list': 
  - [model1/G_1000.pth, model1/config.json]
  - [model2/G_1000.pth, model2/config.json]
```

Option 3:

```
'model_config':
  'model_list': [
    [model1/G_1000.pth, model1/config.json],
    [model2/G_1000.pth, model2/config.json],
  ]
```

# GPU accelerated

## Windows
### Install CUDA
Check the highest version of CUDA supported by your graphics card:
```
nvidia-smi
```
Taking CUDA 11.7 as an example, download it from the [official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-7-0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&amp;target_arch=x86_64&amp;target_version=10&amp;target_type=exe_local)
### Install GPU version of PyTorch

1.13.1+cu117 is recommended, other versions may have memory instability issues.

```
pip install torch==1.13.1+cu117 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```
## Linux
The installation process is similar, but I don't have the environment to test it.

# WebUI

## Inference Frontend

 http://127.0.0.1:23456

*Port is modifiable under the default setting of port 23456.

## Admin Backend

The default address is http://127.0.0.1:23456/admin.

The initial username and password can be found at the bottom of the config.yml file after the first startup.

# Function Options Explanation

## Disable the Admin Backend

The admin backend allows loading and unloading models, and while it has login authentication, for added security, you can disable the admin backend in the `config.yml`:

```yaml
'IS_ADMIN_ENABLED': !!bool 'false'
```

This extra measure helps ensure absolute security when making the admin backend inaccessible to the public network.

## Bert-VITS2 Configuration and Language/Bert Model Usage

Starting from Bert-VITS2 v2.0, a model requires loading three different language Bert models. If you only need to use one or two languages, you can add the `lang` parameter in the `config.json` file of the model's data section. The value `['zh']` indicates that the model only uses Chinese and will load Chinese Bert models. The value `['zh', 'ja']` indicates the usage of both Chinese and Japanese bilingual models, and only Chinese and Japanese Bert models will be loaded. Similarly, this pattern continues for other language combinations.

Example:

```json
"data": {
  "lang": ["zh", "ja"],
  "training_files": "filelists/train.list",
  "validation_files": "filelists/val.list",
  "max_wav_value": 32768.0,
  ...
```
## Custom Chinese Polyphonic Dictionary

If you encounter issues with incorrect pronunciation of polyphonic characters, you can try resolving it using the following method.

Create and open phrases_dict.txt in the project's root directory to add polyphonic words.

```python
{
"一骑当千": [["yí"], ["jì"], ["dāng"], ["qiān"]],
}
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Installation Issues with fastText Dependency

Fasttext may not be installed on windows, you can install it with the following command,or download wheels [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fasttext)

```bash
# For Python 3.10 on win_amd64
pip install https://github.com/Artrajz/archived/raw/main/fasttext/fasttext-0.9.2-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
```

or

```bash
pip install fasttext -i https://pypi.artrajz.cn/simple
```

## Installation Issues with pyopenjtalk Dependency

Since pypi.org does not provide a wheel file for pyopenjtalk, you often need to install it from the source code. This process might be cumbersome for some users, so you can also install it using a pre-built wheel as follows:

```bash
pip install pyopenjtalk -i https://pypi.artrajz.cn/simple
```



## Bert-VITS2 Version Compatibility

To ensure compatibility with the Bert-VITS2 model, modify the config.json file by adding a version parameter "version": "x.x.x". For instance, if the model version is 1.0.1, the configuration file should be written as:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "train": {
    "log_interval": 10,
    "eval_interval": 100,
    "seed": 52,
    ...
```
